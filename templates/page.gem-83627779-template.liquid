<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">UNITED STATES</span> <br>We can ship to virtually any address in the United States. Note that there may be restrictions on some products.</p>
<p><strong>***UNFORTUNATELY, DUE TO COVID AND AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF ORDERS OUR PROCESSING TIME CAN TAKE UP TO 5 OR 6 BUSINESS DAYS, PLEASE CONTACT US WITH ANY QUESTIONS***</strong><br><br>When you place an order, we will estimate shipping and delivery dates for you based on the availability of your items and the shipping options you choose. Depending on the shipping provider you choose, shipping date estimates may appear on the shipping quotes page. Please note that it takes 2-4 business days of handling time for us to ship out orders (unless otherwise noted on the product page). Once your order is shipped we will ship using the method of shipping that you selected. For example: If you select Next Day Air then we will ship using this method after the 2-4 days of handling time.<br><br>Please also note that the shipping rates for many items we sell are weight-based. To reflect the policies of the shipping companies we use, all weights will be rounded up to the next full pound.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTERNATIONAL</span><br>There are many items that we ship outside of the United States. You will see notes on specific product pages if there are shipping restrictions.</p>
<p>Customers are responsible for paying their own taxes and VAT. These amounts will vary with each country and Pro Bike Supply cannot quote or guarantee any country-specific fees. If you have a special shipping request, please include this with the notes in your order.</p>
